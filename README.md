# Tv_Script_Generator
It is a project for autogenrated tv script using data of Seinfield_scripts which is in the filder called data/Seinfield_scripts.txt

I have used pytorch as a library and used Recurrent Neural Network. LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) is used for automated tv script with supervised learning tv scripts automatically genated.

For optimiizer I have used Adam optimizer for optimize my neural network. for the loss I have used Cross Entropy loss to curtail loss of the data.
